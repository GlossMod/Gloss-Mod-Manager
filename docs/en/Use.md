## How to Run

After installation, you can find the GMM program icon on your desktop and in the start menu.

Just run it normally.

Upon opening, the first thing to do is to click on Settings, find `Mod Storage Location`, and change it to any other path. By default, it will be in `C:\Documents\Gloss Mod Manager`, where downloaded compressed files, added mods to the manager, and software update-related files will be stored.
> But don't be silly and set this folder to the game directory. Then the game won't open, and you'll come running saying what to do when the game doesn't open and so on!

The option `Download Complete After Adding to Manager` is recommended to be enabled. As for language and auto-start, you can set them according to your needs.

## Setting Up Game Management

After setting up the manager, find `Manage`, click `Select Game`, then find the directory of your game, select `Game Program`. If your game is downloaded from Steam, the manager will automatically locate the Steam game installation directory.
Here I will take "Baldur's Gate 3" as an example.

If your game is downloaded from the Xbox Store, please open `Select Game by Directory` in `Settings`, then select the game folder to choose the game, otherwise, it will prompt for lack of permission.

## Adding Mods to the Manager

You need to import the Mod into the manager to start installing Mods. You can add them in the following ways:
1. Download and install through the manager:
   - In the manager, find `Browse`, as long as you have selected the managed game, you can search, filter, search, and download the Mods you want here. Click the download button, and it will automatically be added to the download list. After downloading, it will automatically be added to the manager.
2. Browse and download from Mod sites through the manager:
   - Open the Mod site's [Baldur's Gate 3](https://mod.3dmgame.com/baldursgate3) section, find the Mod you want, then click the `One-Click Install` button next to the download button, the browser will ask if you want to open GMM, choose `Open Gloss Mod Manager` to download and add the Mod to the manager.
   - If you find the pop-up window bothersome, you can check `Always allow mod.3dmgame.com to open such links in associated applications`.
   - Then the manager will automatically download and add the Mod to the manager list.
3. Add Mods downloaded from elsewhere to the manager:
   - There might be cases where you cannot find the Mod you want on the Mod site, don't worry, we also support adding Mods downloaded from other places.
   - Method A: Click the `Import Mod` button at the top, select the downloaded Mod compressed file, click `Open`, to add it to the manager for management and installation.
   - Method B: Drag and drop the compressed file into the manager to add it to the manager for management and installation.
   - In addition, we currently support compressed file formats such as.zip,.rar,.7z, and GMM package format.gmm type files.
   - If the Mod you downloaded is not a compressed file, it is recommended to manually compress it into a compressed file for management.
