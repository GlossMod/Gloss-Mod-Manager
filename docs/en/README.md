# Gloss Mod Manager

## What is GMM?

[Gloss Mod Manager](https://mod.3dmgame.com/mod/197445) is a comprehensive modern game mod manager. It was started in June of this year and its purpose is twofold:
1. Lower the barrier to using mods, so that more players will not give up the joy of mods due to not knowing how to install them.
2. As the largest (self-proclaimed) mod resource website in China, how could there not be an official tool of its own?

Thus, GMM was born.

## How to Download?

Currently, the available download channels that I update and maintain are as follows:
- [3DM Mod Station](https://mod.3dmgame.com/mod/197445)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/GlossMod/Gloss-Mod-Manager-info/releases)
- [Cloud Disk](https://cloud.aoe.top/s/rmuL)

In addition, others are not published by me personally. If you download from other places, I cannot guarantee that there is no Trojan virus, but you can check whether it has been hung by the following methods:
- GMM, whether in installation, operation, or use, will not and does not need to request **administrator privileges** (unless you chose "Install for all users" or installed it in the "Program Files" directory of the disk)
- GMM has passed the [ViruStotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) virus check, you can upload the file you downloaded to ViruStotal for virus checking. If any item is marked red, please delete it immediately and download again from the links provided above.

## How to Install?

Simply double-click to run the downloaded `Gloss Mod Manager_1.*.*.exe` program, then follow the normal next step, installation, completion. You can install it in any directory other than `Program Files` and `Program Files (x86)`, even if there are Chinese characters and spaces (theoretically, there should be no problem).
