# Developer Mode

To enter Developer Mode, simply create a file named `DEV` in the GMM directory.

In Developer Mode, you can debug GMM much like you would debug a browser, as most functionalities that can be implemented in a browser can be implemented in GMM.

Developer Mode is intended solely for debugging purposes. Please do not use it for illegal activities!
