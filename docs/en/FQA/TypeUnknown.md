# Handling Unknown Types

If you find that a Mod added to the manager has an unknown type, don't worry about changing its type right away.

- Click on `操作 =》 打开`, which opens the directory of the Mod.

- Check if there is another compressed file inside it. Drag this compressed file into the manager, and it should be recognized normally.

If you find that it's not a compressed file within another compressed file, then you can only manually install it.

For specific installation methods, refer to the installation instructions provided by the author on the Mod release page.
