# Moving Storage Location

If you find the current storage location for your mods not convenient, you can try moving it to a different location.

For example, if you want to move the storage location from `My Documents/Gloss Mod Manager/Mods` to `E://GMM`, you can do the following:

1. Move all contents from the `My Documents/Gloss Mod Manager/Mods` folder to `E://GMM`.
   - Make sure to include the `mod.json` file.
2. In `Settings > Storage Location`, click the "Select" button and choose the `E://GMM` directory.
3. The storage location has now been moved.
4. Press `Ctrl+R` to refresh the data (optional).
