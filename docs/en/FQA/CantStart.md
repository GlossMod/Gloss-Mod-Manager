title: How to Fix Gloss Mod Manager (GMM) Not Opening?

---

## Unable to Start the Software

Firstly, GMM is not compatible with the Windows 7 system. If you are using Windows 7, please upgrade to [Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/software-download/windows10).

Secondly, GMM only supports the x64 version, and 32-bit systems may not be able to run it. If you are using a 32-bit system, it is recommended to switch to a 64-bit system.

### If the System is Correct but Still Cannot Start?

Then you can try the following methods:
- Update your graphics card driver to the latest version.
- Install the software on the C drive. (Default path)
- Disable sandbox mode
  - Right-click the shortcut, properties, add `--no-sandbox` at the end of the target
- Disable hardware acceleration
- Reinstall the software

If the above methods cannot solve your problem, please provide the error log, the method to obtain it is:
- Press Ctrl+R, type cmd
- In the console, enter ` "F:\app\Gloss Mod Manager\Gloss Mod Manager.exe" `
  - Where `F:\app\Gloss Mod Manager\` is the installation path of the manager
  - Enter with double quotes included
- Then provide the error content from the console to me
