# How to Open *.GMM Files

`*.GMM` files are a type of `one-click installation package` packaged by Gloss Mod Manager.

If you have downloaded this type of file without installing GMM, it is recommended that you first [download](/en/README.html#how-to-download) and install GMM.

Then, perform the most basic [initial setup](/en/Use.html).

After that, you can directly double-click to run the `*.gmm` file, which will automatically open GMM and import it.

At this point, you only need to take the next step, which is to import.

## Update Mods

When a new version of the Mod is detected, a small prompt will appear, telling you that there is a new version available.
You can directly click the update button here to get the new version of the Mod or plugin.

## Import Tags

If the author has shared a `tags.json` file, then you can open the folder here, replace the previous file with the `tags.json` file to complete the import of tags.

If you want the tags of the package and your tags to coexist, you can manually edit the `tags.json` file to merge the contents of the two files.

You can preview the modified effect directly in GMM by pressing `Ctrl+R`.

> Note: When editing, please ensure that the file conforms to the `json` format specification.
